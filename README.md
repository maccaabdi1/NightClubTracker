Night Club Capacity Tracker

  The nightclub capacity tracker was designed to help me learn how to develop a full-stack application. 
  Features include: 
  
  - Real-time tracking of people entering and exiting

  - Visual indicators when max capacity is approached or exceeded

  - Responsive user interface (React-based)

  - Persistent storage with PostgreSQL (Client-4 only)

  - Separate increment/decrement buttons for improved UX
